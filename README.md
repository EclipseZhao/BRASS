BRASS
=====

### Breakpoints via assembly

BRASS analyses one or more related BAM files of paired-end sequencing to determine potential rearrangement breakpoints.

There are several stages the main component being:

1. Collect read-pairs where both ends map but **NOT** marked as properly-paired.
2. Perform grouping based on mapped locations
3. Filter
4. Run assembly
5. Annotate with [GRASS](http://cancerit.github.io/grass/)

## Installation

    ./setup.sh path_to_install_to

### Pre-requisites

* The C++ code (within this package) requires the presence of pstreams.h (and associated development libraries).  This is not handled by the `setup.sh` script.

Perl packages:

* [PCAP-core](https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/PCAP-core/releases)
* [cgpVcf](https://github.com/cancerit/cgpVcf/releases)
* [grass](https://github.com/cancerit/grass/releases)

R packages (known to work with 3.1.3), recommend install via package manager:

* [gam](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gam/index.html)
* [poweRlaw](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poweRlaw/index.html)
* [RColorBrewer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html)
* [VGAM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VGAM/index.html)
* [stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html)
* [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)
* These themselves have further dependancies.

R Bioconductor packages (known to work with 3.1.3)
* [copynumber](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/copynumber.html)

Other tools that need to be in path

* [FASTA](https://github.com/wrpearson/fasta36/releases)

###  Tools installed by setup.sh
* Many CPAN hosted libraries, see `perl/Makefile.PL` for the list
* [BLAT](http://hgwdev.cse.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/)
* [exonerate](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/vertebrate-genomics/software/exonerate)
* [Velvet](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/)
* [bedtools2](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases)

Please use `setup.sh` to install these dependencies.  Setting the environment variable `CGP_PERLLIBS` allows you to to append to `PERL5LIB` during install.  Without this all dependancies are installed into the target area.

Please be aware that this expects basic C compilation libraries and tools to be available.

###

## Running BRASS

This package includes a reference implementation which handles all of the linking together of steps.

Please see the ``-h`` and ``-m`` options of ``brass.pl`` for full usage information.

It can be run in a couple of ways:

1. Fire and forget
  * Execute on a single host with multiple cores (or 1 if that's all you have)
  * Some efficiency overhead as some steps aren't parallel
2. Farm style
  * Requires 2 extra parameters in the initial command
  * See ``-help`` for further details

## Input

### Initial mapping

BRASS has primarily been written to work with BWA mapped data.  You are likely to get the most useful output from BWA-mem.

### Library quality

Please be aware that paired-end libraries where properly-paired reads overlap are unlikely to produce good results.

### Additional mapping information

BRASS requires accurate information regarding the insert size distribution and expects to find a ``*.bam.bas`` file
co-located with the ``*.bam``'s.  These can be generated by the ``bam_stats`` program included in the
[PCAP-core](https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/PCAP-core) project.  If you use ``bwa_mem.pl`` to map your
data (same repository) then this file is generated automatically for you.
